```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Overview
In a few (2-3) sentences explain what is going to be reported on.

## Simulations
Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code. Your explanations should make clear what the R code accomplishes.

## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers.

## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance
Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.
    
## Distribution
Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
